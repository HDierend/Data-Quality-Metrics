General quality metrics
####################################

******************
General
******************
Data, regardless of location of recording, temporal dimension, level of pre-processing or type of collection, are subject to certain quality metrics.
These metrics are used to assess how useful or relevant large data sets or collected data are. 

Data sets can be reliably described using the following metrics.

   * `Completeness <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Completeness.html>`_
   * Unambiguous
   * `Correctness <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Correctness.html>`_
   * `Timeliness <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Timeliness.html#>`_
   * `Accuracy <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Accuracy.html#>`_ 
   * `Consistency <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Consistency.html>`_
   * `freedom_from_redundancy <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/freedom_from_redundancy.html>`_
   * `Relevance <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Relevance.html>`_ 
   * `Uniformity <>`_
   * `Reliability <https://data-quality-metrics--21.org.readthedocs.build/en/21/general_quality/Reliability.html>`_ 
   * Comprehensibility

Libraries
********************

Python
=========

`YData <https://github.com/ydataai>`_

ydata_quality is an open-source python library for assessing Data Quality throughout the multiple stages of a data pipeline development.

*A holistic view of the data can only be captured through a look at data from multiple dimensions and ydata_quality evaluates it in a modular way wrapped into a single Data Quality engine.
This repository contains the core python source scripts and walkthrough tutorials.*

`Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_

*Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.*

MATLAB
=========

C++
=========
