The data should match the conditions in reality as closely as possible. Measurement data should have as low an error value as possible. 

Detecting anomalies in a dataset can be critical for some businesses if hasty conclusions are drawn or hasty decisions are made.
To rid data sets of such anomalies, these outliers must be identified. Outliers are values that are irrationally far from their expected value.
The danger of outliers is that they influence average values and the standard deviation. 

Outliers can be values of just one variable or combination of at least two variables that can be considered as outliers.
