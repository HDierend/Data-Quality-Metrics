Uniformity
####################################

*********
Description
*********

The information of a data set must be structured in a uniform way.
Data of the same type should also have the same dimensions.

Uniformity is therefore specific to metrics and units of measurement, and is particularly important when data comes from different sources.

In the following examples, data will be compared for uniformity and if necessary recalculated to fit uniformity.
