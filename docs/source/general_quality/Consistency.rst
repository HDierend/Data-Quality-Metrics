Consistency
####################################

*********
Description
*********
A data set must not have any contradictions within itself or with other data sets.
Data are inconsistent if different valid states are not compatible with each other.

Consistency is for measuring if two data values derived by different sets aren't conflicting with each other.
The percent of values that match across various records is a common data quality metric for consistency.
Timelines help to measure the accuracy of data at a specific period

Consistency refers primarily to the use of data by different users.
Examples of consistent data usually refer to data formats and data types that should be identical throughout in order to maintain a required level of data quality.

Inconsistencies in data can be due to changes over time and/or across variables for example, in

   * Vintages or time periods
   * Units
   * Levels of accuracy
   * Levels of completeness
   * Types of inclusion or exclusions.
