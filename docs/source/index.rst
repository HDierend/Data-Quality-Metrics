.. note::

   This project is under active development and not close to beeing finished. First and foremost,
   this page aims to provide data analysts who deal primarily with field data with an overview of
   analysis options in order to be able to assess the quality of their data and evaluate it objectively. 

   This page is a small part of the tasks supervised by the NFD4Ing archetype Golo.
   Golo is largely concerned with field data in a scientific context.
